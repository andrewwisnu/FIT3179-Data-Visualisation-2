          <p> Japan is known as the pioneer for high-speed railways with the Shinkansen. Throughout the years, other
            countries saw the pontential and wanted to have high-speed trains of their own. Overall, there are more than <span class="bold">10</span>
            different trains that could cruise well over <span class="bold">250 km/h</span>.
          </p>
          <p> With the <span class="bold">top 7</span> of the fastest amongst the trains listed, <span class="bold">two</span> of them
            are the Japanese made Shinkansens. The <span class="bold">E5 Shinkansen</span> is the earlier model that has been in service
            for a while. Meanwhile, the <span class="bold">L0 Shinkansen</span> is the newly developed one, which could reach a maximum
            speed of around <span class="bold">500 km/h</span>, smoking other high-speed railways currently in service.
          </p>
          <p> Not only in terms of speed, Shinkansen also excels in terms of <span class="bold">Passenger Capacity</span>. Shinkansens, even the earlier model,
            could carry passengers of capacity around <span class="bold">700 people</span>. In comparison, other high-speed trains on average could only
            carry around <span class="bold">500 people</span>. Only the "CRH2C China Railways" train that closes the gap with around
            <span class="bold">600 people</span>. Shinkansen still holds the crown for the most spacious high-speed railways in service.

      <p> Shinkansen of different lines would have different <span class="bold">Passenger Ridership</span>, 
      <span class="bold">Covered Distance</span>, and even <span class="bold">Top Speed</span>. We wanted to find out if there
      are correlation between these three <span class="bold">performance measures</span>.
    </p>
    <p> One observation we could determine is that the <span class="bold">distance</span> covered by the train is <span class="bold">directly proportional</span>
      to the <span class="bold">top speed</span>. If the distance covered by the train is large, then the train's speed would
      need to be <span class="bold">faster</span> to save time. 
    </p>
    <p> For the <span class="bold">passenger ridership</span>, we couldn't observe any regular pattern output in relation
      to the distance and speed. We got two observations in which the ridership is high, but for <span class="bold">Joetsu</span>, both the distance and top speed
      are <span class="bold">low</span>, and the opposite is true for <span class="bold">Tokaido</span>.
